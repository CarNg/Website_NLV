                    <p> Arcade is a small scene developed in Unity
                        that features <a href="gameprojects/turntable.html">Turntable</a> as a mini game.
                        It was developed as part of a Games Programming assignment.
                        The idea was to demonstrate what we covered in C# in Unity
                        including Mecanim for animation, retention and use of state variables and AI.<br>

                    <p>Sketch is a 2D game that takes place in a classroom.
                        The goal is to collect a variety of gifts to give to your crush in order to woo her - but don’t get caught.
                        Get caught three times and you’ll get detention! Successfully fill the swoon meter however and you’ll get the girl!

                    <p>Turntable is a physics game inspired by pinball, pachinko and peggle but with a twist.
                        The goal of the game is to get the high score by guiding the balls into the corresponding score pockets.
                        Lose all three lives by letting them fall into the side pockets and you’ve lost.<br>
                        <br>This version of the game does not save your score. However, the version featured in ‘<a href="gameprojects/arcade.html">Arcade</a>' does.<br>

                    <p>Hopscotch 2: Elements was designed as part of a small assignment for a ludology class.
                        The task was to design and play a sequel to a game that is over 50 years old.
                        I worked with Aisling Flynn, Philippa Kelly and Diana VoLovei on the game.<br>

                    Analog - Storytelling Card Game (Party Game)
                    <p>Anything But Small Talk! is the first game I have designed and it is a personal favourite.
                        It was inspired by three specific things: YouTube's SourceFedNERD’s ‘Table Talk' series,
                        Apollo Robbins' TED Talk on 'The Art of Misdirection' and my own introversion.<br>
                        <br>These three different topics were on my mind at the time of designing the game and
                        something had me believing they could work well together. As a result,
                        ABST! was born based on the themes of memory, misdirection and conversation.

                        Pigeon Invasion was developed as part of a production class
                        where we were able to become familiar with the process of developing an app
                        from the idea stages straight through to the release and promotion stages.
                        It is a casual mobile game based off of Sega's 'Choplifter'.
