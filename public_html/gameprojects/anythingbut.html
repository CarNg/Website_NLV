                <b>Anything But Small Talk!</b><br>
                    Anything But Small Talk! (ABST!) is the first game I had designed and it is actually a personal favourite.
                    It was inspired by three specific things: the idea behind YouTube channel SourceFedNERD’s ‘Table Talk' series,
                    Apollo Robbins' TED Talk on 'The Art of Misdirection' and my own introversion.
                
                <p>These three very different topics were on my mind at the time of designing the game and
                    something had me believing they could work well together. As a result,
                    ABST! was born based on the themes of memory, misdirection and conversation.
                </p>
                <p><b>Why 'ABST!'?</b><br>
                    I had been reading about introversion when I came across the quote
                    “Introverts do not hate small talk because we dislike people.
                    We hate small talk because we hate the barrier it creates between people." by Laurie Helgoe.
                    That was something that I felt so strongly about and I wanted to design a game that would
                    allow people to skip the the small talk. I wanted a game that would encourage us to listen and to give players the opportunity
                    to get to know other and share stories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where the series ‘Table Talk’ comes in.
                    The way the series works is that fans would submit topics or questions for the presenters to then discuss/answer.
                    It had crossed my mind as I was watching the show that there are so many interesting or even simple topics that
                    just doesn’t come up in every day conversations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mundane or silly as the question “do you believe in ghosts or aliens?” can seem,
                    it amazes me how much you can learn about or from someone by asking it.
                    If I were to ask a stranger that the first time we met, I would seem crazy and yet,
                    it’s perfectly normal to discuss the weather for fifteen minutes.
                    ABST! is intended to make it okay to skip past all that. Besides, I suck at small talk,
                    it just ends up being awkward anyway so why not have fun with it. So how does it work?
                </p>
                <p><b>Gameplays</b><br>
                    Here are the basics: All you’ll need is a (recommended) minimum of 4 players and a set of cards with different topics
                    (conversation points) along with a specific question relating to the topic written on them.
                    A simple example *topic may be ‘Favourite Movie’ and sample question can be ‘Who are my favourite character(s)?’
                </p>
                <p>
                    Player one will draw a card and the topic (and ONLY the topic) will be shared among the players to be discussed for the
                    next *five minutes. During this time, player one MUST mention the answer to the question on their card at least twice.
                    In this example, they must mention who their favourite characters were twice. Their objective is to do so subtly.
                    This is where ‘Apollo Robbin’s ‘The Art of Misdirection’ comes in. Your goal is the misdirect the other players from the real question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, the goal of the other players is to (try) pick out what the question is and then the answer to the topic and
                    remember it. All while trying to distract the other players from doing the same. Once everyone has had a go,
                    each player will ask the question that is on their card.
                </p>
                <p>
                    E.g After four rounds (as there are four players) player one will now ask everyone ‘Who are my favourite character(s)?’.
                    For each wrong answer, player one will get a point. For every answer another player gets right, they get two points.
                    he cycle continues and the first player to *reach 10 points wins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>You can set the rules too!</b><br>
                    ABST! is an extremely flexible game. There are a number of rules that can be tailored to suit the environment
                    you’re playing in. The above is simply a guideline. The asterisks indicate where alterations can be made.
                    You can decide how a player wins. You may decide that instead of first to x amount of points,
                    you have most points after x amount of rounds. You can eliminate time limits altogether. For example,
                    at the start of a dinner party, each participant may pick a card each and the conversations carry on all night until
                    the questions are revealed/asked in the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, you control the topics! The stories you share can be real, they can be made up.
                    They can be hypothetical questions or factual. The answers can be as serious or as silly and light-hearted as you want.
                    That’s all up to you, have fun with it! Like I mentioned at the start, ABST! is a personal favourite of mine,
                    if you test it out and play it with your friends, let me know! Happy conversing!
