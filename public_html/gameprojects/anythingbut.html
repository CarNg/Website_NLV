                <i>We're currently working on a print and play prototype of ABST!. Check the news section on the
                    <a href="../index.html">home page</a> for more details.</i><br>
                <br><b>Anything But Small Talk!</b><br>
                    Anything But Small Talk! (ABST!) is the first game I designed and it is a personal favourite.
                    It is inspired by three things: the idea behind YouTube channel SourceFedNERD’s ‘Table Talk' series,
                    Apollo Robbins' TED Talk on 'The Art of Misdirection' and my own introversion. These three very different
                    topics were on my mind at the time of designing the game and something had me believing they could work
                    well together. So, this storytelling card game was born based on the themes of memory, misdirection and conversation.
                <p><b>Why 'ABST!'?</b><br>
                    I had been reading about introversion when I came across the quote “Introverts do not hate small talk because we
                    dislike people. We hate small talk because we hate the barrier it creates between people." by Laurie Helgoe.
                    That was something that I felt so strongly about that I wanted to design a game that would allow people to skip
                    the small talk. I wanted a game that would encourage us to listen and give players the opportunity
                    to get to know other and share stories. This is where the series ‘Table Talk’ comes in.
                </p>
                <p>The way the series works is that fans would submit topics or questions for the presenters to then discuss/answer.
                    It had crossed my mind as I was watching the show that there are so many interesting or even simple topics that
                    just doesn’t come up in every day conversations. As mundane or silly as the question “do you believe in ghosts or aliens?”
                    can seem, it amazes me how much you can learn about someone by asking it. If I were to ask a stranger that the first
                    time we met, I would seem crazy and yet, it’s perfectly normal to discuss the weather for fifteen minutes. ABST! is intended
                    to make it okay to skip past all that. Besides, I'm horrible at it, it's awkward more often than not so why not have fun with it.
                </p>
                <p><b>Gameplay</b><br>
                    So how does it all work? Each card will have a conversation topic and a question relating to the topic. Let's use a
                    simple example: the topic may be ‘Favourite Movie’ and the question can be ‘Who are my favourite character(s)?’. Player
                    one will draw a card and share <b>only</b> the topic with the rest of the group. Then for the next *five minutes, the group can
                    discuss and talk about that topic. During this time, the player who drew the card <b>must</b> mention the answer to the question
                    on their card at least twice. In this example, they must mention who their favourite characters are twice. Their objective is to
                    do so subtly. This is where ‘Apollo Robbin’s ‘The Art of Misdirection’ comes in. Your goal is the misdirect the other players from
                    the real question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, the goal of the other players is to (try and) figure out what the question is and remember the answer. All while trying
                    to distract the other players from doing the same. Once every player has had a go, each player will ask the question that is on
                    their card. E.g After four rounds (as there are four players) player one will now ask everyone ‘Who are my favourite character(s)
                    in my favourite movie?’. For each wrong answer, player one will get a point. For every answer a player gets right, they get two points.
                    The cycle continues and the first player to reach *10 points wins.
                </p>
                <p><b>*You can set the rules too!</b><br>
                    ABST! is an extremely flexible game and there are many variants that can be tailored to suit the environment
                    you’re playing in. The above is simply a guideline. The asterisks indicates where alterations can be made. You can vary how long
                    each discussion is and how many points are required to win. You can even switch it up by changing the winning conditions.
                    You may decide that instead of first to x amount of points, you have most points after x amount of rounds. Or maybe it's game night,
                    or a dinner party and you want conversation to flow all night. You can eliminate time limits altogether. For example,
                    at the start of the night, each participant draws a card each and conversation on those topics carry on throughout the night.
                    At the end of the night, the questions are asked and the best listener wins!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, you can control the topics! We're working on a prototype but that doesn't stop you guys from being creative.
                    You make the decisions! The stories you share can be real or they can be made up.
                    They can be hypothetical questions or factual. The answers can be as serious or as silly and light-hearted as you want.
                    That’s all up to you, make it suit your game group, have fun with it! If you give the game a go, I'd love to hear about it.
                    Happy conversing!
                </p>
                <p><b>Results and Experience</b><br>
                    As mentioned in the beginning, we're working on a prototype and the game is still just an idea with no real playtesting.
                    However, it is a personal favourite and this is for a number of reasons. One of them is that it's my first game. The only instruction
                    I had was to come up and design the basis for a non digital game. I had no clue what to do for the theme and I had a small
                    understanding of mechanics. Despite all that, it was a fun and exciting process that I quickly fell in love with. Once I had
                    an idea for for a theme, the design grew and the prospect of making and sharing the game was thrilling. Not only was I designing
                    a game that I wanted to play, I was designing it based on something I cared about deeply. It's for this reason that ABST! will
                    always have a soft spot in my heart.
