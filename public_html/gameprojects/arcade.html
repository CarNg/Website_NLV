                <b>Aracde</b><br>
                    Arcade is a small scene developed in Unity as part of a Games Programming assignment.
                    The idea was to demonstrate what we learned in C# for Unity. We were asked to demonstrate
                    a number of different skills. These skills included: using various game object types, event handling,
                    appropriate use of physics and audio content, Mecanim for animation, retention and use of state variables
                    and finally, design and implementation of a HUD, game controls and some form of AI.
                <p>All of these requirements were achieved in Arcade. The game features '<a href="turntable.html">Turntable</a>',
                    a physics game built in Unity, as a mini game. This version of Turntable features saving, which was not
                    originally implemented. Some features that appear in Arcade but not in the other games I have developed
                    includes animation using Mecanim and the implementation of AI logic.
                </p>
                <p><b>Why 'Arcade'?</b>
                    As mentioned, Arcade was developed from a programming aspect rather than game design.
                    It is a small scene to demonstrates a number of features. The opening arcade scene
                    allowed me to demonstrate such skills as AI, animation and HUD implementation while the
                    Turntable mini game allowed me to demonstrate saving. Arcade also gave me the opportunity
                    to refine Turntable's design.
