                <b>Aracde</b><br>
                    Arcade is a small scene developed in Unity as part of a Games Programming assignment.
                    The idea was to demonstrate what we learned in C# for Unity. We were asked to demonstrate
                    a number of different skills. These skills included: using various game object types, event handling,
                    appropriate use of physics and audio content, Mecanim for animation, retention and use of state variables
                    and finally, design and implementation of a HUD, game controls and some form of AI.
                <p><b>Why 'Arcade'?</b><br>
                    Arcade was developed from a programming aspect rather than game design. So the goal was to develop a small
                    scene that would demonstrate a number of features. As a result, there are two parts to Arcade. There's the opening
                    scene where the player controls a character around an aracde. This scene demonstrates a number of things such as
                    Mecanim animation in all the characters, including NPCs and AI the arcade employee. Arcade was also used as an opportunity
                    to refine <a href="turntable.html">Turntable</a>. Here, I was able to add saving features to the game as well as refine
                    some controls. By incorporating Turntable into the game, I was also able to introduce saving with the coins and tickets 
                    system in the game.
                </p>
                <p><b>Gameplay</b><br>
                    The game involves the player in an arcade where they can play Turntable where they will be able to win tickets dependent
                    on the score they get in the game. These tickets can then be exchanged for coins in order to play more games of Turntable.
                    In order to do this, the player simply has to go up to the desk where the employee will exchange them. For more informaiton

                </p>
                <p><b>Project Role</b><br>
                    Arcade was a solo project. I can take credit for the programming and game design of the game. However, all models, audio and art
                    work is not mine. If there are any issues regarding this, please <a href="../contact.html">contact me</a> and I will make
                    amends immediately.
                </p>
                <p><b>Results and Experience</b><br>
                    Arcade was a great exercise for myself to become familiar with C# and Unity. It allowed me to work with and learn a number of
                    different functions and aspects of programming. Many of the things I learned from working in Arcade was later applied and expanded
                    upon in different projects. Although, many of the things in Arcade were simple and the basics, it helped significantly in understanding
                    the basics allowing me to further expand and develop on them for later uses in future games.
