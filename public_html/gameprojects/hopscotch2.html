                <b>Hopscotch 2: Elements</b><br>
                    Hopscotch 2: Elements is an 'unnecessary sequel' designed as part of a ludology class. The task was to design and
                    play a sequel to a game that is over 50 years old. We had to pick a game and examine it. We had to decide
                    what we believed to be the weak points of the game and come up with ideas to solve those issues.
                <p><b>Why Elements?</b><br>
                    The goal was to find some of the flaws in the original games and to come up with solutions that would amend them.
                    We found that hopscotch is repetitive which can become quite boring, especially with its simplicity and detachment from other players
                    (there isn't much interaction between players). Our solution was to make the "track" movable and add elements to the game.
                    This introduced more play-ability, strategy and difficulty.</p>
                <p><b>Gameplay</b><br>
                    The track is made up of separate pieces, this can be pieces of card or foam which is associated with one of the four elements.
                    The track is then constructed of a randomised element pattern and each player is assigned one element.
                    The first element on the track indicates which player's turn it is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The player may only hop on their own assigned element. Once they are one the second element,
                    they must pick up the first and carry it with them till the end of the track. Once they are there,
                    they must place it down at the end. Therefore, creating a new pattern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each player also gets one "stone", this is simply a small object that they can toss. They may use this once during a game.
                    The player is allowed to step on the piece that the stone lands on, aiding them on more difficult patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a player falls or steps on the wrong element, they are eliminated along with their elements on the track.
                    The aim is to be the last one standing.
                </p>
                <p><b>Project Role</b>
                        
                </p>
                <p><b>Results and Experience</b><br>
                    As with any game design project, we put it to the test. We found that the new elements (pun intended) made it more fun and engaging.
                    It created more interaction between players as other players' actions affected how you would have to take your turn which also added
                    the strategy to the game. It also became more challenging as difficulty levels would increase as the game went on and players were
                    eliminated. It ended up being a fun way to spice Hopscotch up!
