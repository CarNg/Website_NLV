                    <b>This Time Around</b><br>
                    'This Time Around' is the latest and largest finished project of Night Light Visuals. It was developed as part of a MSc's final
                    project. It is an exploration/interactive story game based on the themes of forgiveness and memories. Players adopt the role of
                    Rachel Daniels and begins the journey of learning the Daniels' family story. Alden Nowlan's quote "The day the child realizes that all adults are imperfect,
                    he becomes an adolescent; the day he forgives them, he becomes an adult; the day he forgives himself, he becomes wise." makes up the
                    spine of the game.
                <p>However, that's information you'll find on This Time Around's social media sites. You're here for more than that so here's the scoop.
                    Do people still say scoop? Probably not, but here it is anyway. This Time Around has gone through more iterations than I can count
                    since the initial idea for the digital game. So let's begin.
                </p>
                <p><b>Why 'This Time Around'?</b><br>
                    This Time Around was originally inspired by a non-digital game I had designed called <a href="anythingbut.html">Anything But Small Talk!</a>.
                    It was an unfinished project that I loved and wanted to develop further. Since I was in the beginning stages of designing a game for my final
                    project, the idea of taking certain aspects from ABST! and applying it to a digital game became appealing. As development went on however,
                    the core ideas from ABST! became secondary or even tertiary factors of This Time Around as translating the mechanics into a one player digital game
                    became difficult. Slowly, it took on a more Gone Home type experience and became what it is today.
                </p>
                <p>As for the inspiration for the premise and story of This Time Around, it's a more personal one.
                    Wanting to keep the idea of memories within the game, I was reminded of my own memory <strike>problems</strike>.
                    As someone who has trouble remembering their own childhood, if I can remember any at all, the idea of discovering it all again
                    (essentially, for the first time) was fascinating to me.
                </p>
                <p>I wanted to pursue the idea that by revisiting your past you can learn and see things in a new perspective
                    that you may have never considered. As a player, you adopt the character you're playing. Often times, players don't know
                    the charcters' history or background. You discover these things on your own and in your own time.
                    Much like if I were to delve into my own childhood, most of which I don't remember.
                </p>
                <p>The idea behind This Time Around is that the player will (re)discover these memories along with Rachel,
                    (re)learning things you may have forgotten or have never even examined before. As This Time Around's social media will say:
                    So often we forget to look at things from someone else's perspective, and we forget that everyone that comes and goes
                    in our lives leaves behind a part of them within us. Good or bad, we learn from them. This Time Around aims to be that reminder.
                </p>
                <p><b>Project Role</b><br>
                    This Time Around was a solo project. I designed the mechanics of the game and wrote the story that
                    would become the backbone of the game. Along with this, I built and programmed the game in Unity. The models and audio used in the game
                    however, are not mine. They are sourced from <a href="http://archive3d.net/">archive3d</a> and <a href="https://www.freesound.org/">freesound</a>.
                    The interface and menu design within the game was designed by myself. Other roles in the project included recruiting testers and testing,
                    reviewing results, making adjustments and any promotion work on social media sites.

                </p>
                <p><b>Results and Experience</b><br>
                    This Time Around took almost a year from initial idea stages to the finished product. It was a long and tedious process that took
                    many, many iterations and testing to complete.
