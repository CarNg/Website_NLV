                <br>I began my love affair with game design during the course of my MSc where I developed and designed a
                number of digital as well as non-digital games. Learning about game development and game design has been
                a new and exciting adventure and I am thrilled to be able to share some of these projects with you.<br>
                
                <br><b>NB:</b> As these projects were a part of college assignments from a game design and games programming POV,
                original audio and art work weren't always implemented. Therefore, some art and audio work from these projects
                are from external sources. Information on each project regarding this will be expanded on individually.<br>

                <br>Visual Communication has always been something that has fascinated me and I've always wanted to explore it.
                Luckily, I was able to do that during my undergraduate and postgraduate courses. I was able to delve into the
                world of visual media, from photography and videography to web design and graphic design.<br>
                
                <br>Between the two courses and a number of personal projects, I've been able to work with and gain skills
                in a number of softwares and languages. This includes the Adobe Creative Suite and Final Cut, and languages
                such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.<br>

                <br>Right now, we’re working on <a class="gameLinks" href="gameprojects/sketch.html">Sketch</a> 2.0. Audio and art for the game will be completely revamped and
                there’ll be a few mechanic changes. There may or may not be new levels added too! Updates will follow soon! Not only this, but we’re also
                working on <a class="gameLinks" href="gameprojects/anythingbut.html">Anything But Small Talk!</a>. Some refinements, artwork and possibly a prototype are
                on the way! Both of these games have been personal favourites to design and make so I'm excited to work on and share the games and ideas.
                Lastly, ideas for new tabletop games are floating around left and right lately and I look forward to getting the time to design
                and make a prototype soon. That is, as soon as Sketch and ABST! get their feet on the ground. So, stay tuned, updates and much more to come
                soon!<br>
                <br><span style="font-size:20px; text-shadow: 0px 0px 8px #e01bbd; color: white;"><b>Latest Project</b></span><br>
                <br>This Time Around, an exploration/interactive fiction game, is the latest project of Night Light Visuals. It was a year long
                project and by far, the largest. If you'd like to check it out, it is available now to download and play on
                <a class="gameLinks" href='http://nightlightvisuals.itch.io/thistimearound'>itch.io</a> and you can find more
                information on the game <a class="gameLinks" href="gameprojects/thistimearound.html">here</a>. If you give it a shot, we'd love to hear what you think!<br>
                <br><span style="font-size:20px; text-shadow: 0px 0px 8px #e01bbd; color: white;"><b>Last but not least,</b></span><br>
                <br>I wanted to keep a spot on the home page to say a special thank you to Julie, Stevie, Conan, Becca and everyone who has been in front of or
                behind the camera to help me with any of the projects featured on the site; and a huge thank you to anyone and everyone who I have played,
                tested and worked with on a game. This site would be half of what it is without you.. Literally. So, thank you.
