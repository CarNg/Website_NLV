                    <p>I began my love affair with game design during the course of my MSc where I developed and designed a
                    number of digital as well as non-digital games. Learning about game development and game design has been
                    a new and exciting adventure and I am thrilled to be able to share some of these projects with you.</p>

                    <p>Every project that is worked on has a story and meaning behind it and every project changes and grows as it comes together.
                    Night Light Visuals' blog is where this is all documented. From why and how a project started to updates to all the current projects;
                    it's all there. It's almost a 'behind the scenes' of sorts.</p>

                    <p>Visual Communication has always been something that has fascinated me and I've always wanted to explore it.
                    Luckily, I was able to do that during my undergraduate and postgraduate courses. I was able to delve into the
                    world of visual media, from photography and videography to web design and graphic design.</p>

                <br>Right now, we’re working on <a class="gameLinks" href="gameprojects/anythingbut.html">Anything But Small Talk!</a>.
                Some design refinements, some artwork and a prototype are on the way. We're also working on
                <a class="gameLinks" href="gameprojects/sketch.html">Sketch</a> 2.0. Audio and art for the game is being completely revamped and
                there’ll be a few mechanic changes too.
                Both of these games have been personal favourites to design so I'm excited to work on and share them!
                Check out our <a class="gameLinks" href="http://nightlightvisuals.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> for updates as we're working on them.<br>
                <br>Lastly, ideas for new tabletop games are floating around left, right and center lately and I look forward to getting the time to design
                and make a prototype soon. That is, as soon as Sketch and ABST! get their feet on the ground. So, stay tuned!<br>

                <br>I wanted to keep a spot on the home page to say a special thank you to Julie, Stevie, Conan, Becca and everyone who has been in front of or
                behind the camera to help me with any of the projects featured on the site; and a big thank you to anyone and everyone who I have played,
                tested and worked with on a game. This site would be half of what it is without you.. Literally. So, thank you.
