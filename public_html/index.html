                    <p>I began my love affair with game design during the course of my MSc where I developed and designed a
                    number of digital as well as non-digital games. Learning about game development and game design has been
                    a new and exciting adventure and I am thrilled to be able to share some of these projects with you.<br>

                    <br><b>NB:</b> As these projects were a part of college assignments from a game design and games programming POV,
                    original audio and art work weren't always implemented. Therefore, some art and audio work from these projects
                    are from external sources. Information on each project regarding this will be expanded on individually.<br></p>

                    <p>Visual Communication has always been something that has fascinated me and I've always wanted to explore it.
                    Luckily, I was able to do that during my undergraduate and postgraduate courses. I was able to delve into the
                    world of visual media, from photography and videography to web design and graphic design.<br>

                    <br>Between the two courses and a number of personal projects, I've been able to work with and gain skills
                    in a number of softwares and languages. This includes the Adobe Creative Suite and Final Cut, and languages
                    such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery.<br></p>

                <br>Right now, we’re working on <a class="gameLinks" href="gameprojects/sketch.html">Sketch</a> 2.0. Audio and art for the game is being completely revamped and
                there’ll be a few mechanic changes too. We’re also working on <a class="gameLinks" href="gameprojects/anythingbut.html">Anything But Small Talk!</a> right now.
                Some design refinements, artwork and possibly a prototype are on the way.
                Both of these games have been personal favourites to design so I'm excited to work on and share them!
                Check out our <a class="gameLinks" href="http://nightlightvisuals.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> for updates on what we're working on.<br>
                <br>Lastly, ideas for new tabletop games are floating around left and right lately and I look forward to getting the time to design
                and make a prototype soon. That is, as soon as Sketch and ABST! get their feet on the ground. So, stay tuned, updates and more to come
                soon.<br>

                <br>I wanted to keep a spot on the home page to say a special thank you to Julie, Stevie, Conan, Becca and everyone who has been in front of or
                behind the camera to help me with any of the projects featured on the site; and a big thank you to anyone and everyone who I have played,
                tested and worked with on a game. This site would be half of what it is without you.. Literally. So, thank you.
