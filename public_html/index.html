                Over the course of my MSc, I developed and designed a number of digital as well as non-digital games
                both as a group and as solo projects. Learning about game development and game design has been a new
                and exciting journey and I am thrilled to be able to share some of these projects with you.

                <br>*NB As these projects are a part of college assignments from a game design and games programming POV,
                original audio and art work was not implemented. Therefore, some art and audio work from these projects
                are sourced from across the internet. Information on each project regarding this will be expanded on individually.

                Both my undergraduate and postgraduate courses have helped me gain experience in all forms of visual media.
                My undergraduate course allowed me to work in photography, videography, web and graphic design;
                leaving me with skills in Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, HTML and CSS, Premiere and Final Cut.<br>
                <br>My postgraduate course offered me the opportunity to delve further into videography by working with After Effects.
                The course has also allowed me to gain a further understanding of web design and web building with the addition of Javascript.
                Examples of my work can be found by clicking the image above.
