                    <p>Recently, we've been working on a <a class="visualLinks" href="gameprojects/anythingbut.html">Anything But Small Talk!</a> prototype,
                        as well as a new version of <a class="visualLinks" href="gameprojects/sketch.html">Sketch</a>.
                        Both of these have been personal favourites so I'm excited to share new iterations of them!<br>
                        <br> Alongside game projects, personal video projects are always being produced as well. <br>

                        <p>I began my love affair with game design during the course of my MSc where I developed and designed a
                        number of digital as well as non-digital games. Learning about game development and game design has been
                        a new and exciting adventure and I am thrilled to be able to share some of these projects with you.</p>

                        <p>Every project that is worked on has a story and meaning behind it and every project changes and grows as it comes together.
                        Night Light Visuals' blog is where this is all documented. From why and how a project started to updates to all the current projects;
                        it's all there. It's almost a 'behind the scenes' of sorts.</p>

                        <p>Visual Communication has always been something that has fascinated me and I've always wanted to explore it.
                        Luckily, I was able to do that during my undergraduate and postgraduate courses. I was able to delve into the
                        world of visual media, from photography and videography to web design and graphic design.</p>

                Some design refinements, artwork and prototype are on the way. We're also working on
                <a class="gameLinks" href="gameprojects/sketch.html">Sketch</a> 2.0. Audio and art for the game is being completely revamped and
                there’ll be a few mechanic changes too.
                Both of these have been personal favourites so I'm excited to work on and share them!<br>
