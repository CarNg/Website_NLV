                <br>Over the course of my MSc, I developed and designed a number of digital as well as non-digital games
                both as a group and as solo projects. Learning about game development and game design has been a new
                and exciting journey and I am thrilled to be able to share some of these projects with you.

                <br>*NB As these projects are a part of college assignments from a game design and games programming POV,
                original audio and art work was not implemented. Therefore, some art and audio work from these projects
                are sourced from across the internet. Information on each project regarding this will be expanded on individually.

                <br>Both my undergraduate and postgraduate courses have helped me gain experience in all forms of visual media.
                My undergraduate course allowed me to work in photography, videography, web and graphic design;
                leaving me with skills in Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, HTML and CSS, Premiere and Final Cut.<br>
                <br>My postgraduate course offered me the opportunity to delve further into videography by working with After Effects.
                The course has also allowed me to gain a further understanding of web design and web building with the addition of Javascript.
                Examples of my work can be found by clicking the image above.

                Right now, we’re working on <a href="gameprojects/sketch.html">Sketch</a> 2.0. Audio and art for the game will be completely revamped and
                there’ll be a few mechanic changes. There may or may not be new levels added too! Updates will follow soon! Not only this, but we’re also
                working on <a href="gameprojects/anythingbut.html">Anything But Small Talk!</a>. Some refinements, artwork and possibly a prototype are
                on the way! Both of these games have been personal favourites to design and make so I'm excited to work on and share the games and ideas.
                Lastly, ideas for new tabletop games are floating around left and right lately and I look forward to getting the time to design
                and make a prototype soon. That is, as soon as Sketch and ABST! get their feet on the ground. So, stay tuned, updates and much more to come
                soon!<br>

                This Time Around, an exploration/interactive fiction game, is the latest project of Night Light Visuals. It was a year long
                project and by far, the largest. If you'd like to check it out, it is available now to download and play on
                <a href='http://nightlightvisuals.itch.io/thistimearound'>itch.io</a> and you can find more
                information on the game <a href="gameprojects/thistimearound.html">here</a>. If you give it a shot, we'd love to hear what you think!<br>
                <br><span style="font-size:18px; text-shadow: 0px 0px 8px #e01bbd; color: white;"><b>Last but not least,</b></span><br>
                I wanted to keep a spot on the home page to say a special thank you to Julie, Stevie, Conan, Becca and everyone who has been in front of or
                behind the camera to help me with any of the projects featured on the site; and a huge thank you to anyone and everyone who I have played,
                tested and worked with on a game. This site would be half of what it is without you.. Literally. So, thank you.
