                Photography - Night and Long Exposure Photography
                <p>Night photography and long exposures has always been a side of photography that I loved.
                    There's something about them that, to me, simultaneously freezes and captures
                    the passing of time perfectly. It's that ability to capture the passing of time in one shot
                    that makes long exposures and night photography so special to me.<br>
                    <br>A series of light paintings, long exposures and night photographs.

                Photography - Series of Portraits
                <p>Portraits have always been a strange thing to me.
                    We are surrounded by people but how often to we really look at people.
                    How odd would it be to just sit and stare at someone? To examine them and gauge how they feel
                    just with our sight. Portraits allow us to do that. It's one moment where we can truly <i>look</i>
                    at someone. How the shadow falls on their face, their body posture, their smile, their frown, their movement.
                    It's all there.<br>
                    <br> A series of portraits taken in and out of the studio, tactfully and candidly.
