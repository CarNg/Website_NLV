                <b>Photography</b> - Night and Long Exposures
                <p>Night photography and long exposures has always been a side of photography that I loved.
                    There's something about them that, to me, simultaneously freezes and captures
                    the passing of time perfectly. It's that ability to capture the passing of time in one shot
                    that makes long exposures and night photography so special to me.<br>

                <b>Photography</b> - Series of Portraits
                <p>Portraits have always been a strange thing to me.
                    We are surrounded by people but how often to we really look at people.
                    How odd would it be to just sit and stare at someone? To examine them and gauge how they feel
                    just with our sight. Portraits allow us to do that. It's one moment where we can truly <i>look</i>
                    at someone. How the shadow falls, their posture, their smile, their frown.
                    It's all there.<br>
                    <br> A series of portraits taken in and out of the studio, tactfully and candidly.
